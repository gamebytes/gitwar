Gitfight
========

Git-based fighting game

You're in a fist-fight with a friend. It could be a boxing match, bar
fight, back alley possee showdown. Whatever your imagination decides.
That's the beauty of text-based games.


Types of punches you can throw:

- H - Haymaker
- U - Uppercut
- L - Left hook
- J - Jab

Pay attention to that order. The later in the list the more likely your
punch will strike your opponent. But keep in mind the riskier punches
deal more damage when they do land.

Get to fighting!
