Gitfight
========

Git-based fighting game

You're in a fist-fight with a friend. It could be a boxing match, bar
fight, back alley possee showdown. Whatever your imagination decides.
That's the beauty of text-based games.

Tell gitfight what kind of punch you'd like to throw. Possible values
are: H for HAYMAKER, U for UPPERCUT, L for LEFT HOOK, and J for JAB.

Pay attention to that order. The later in the list the more likely your
punch will strike your opponent. But keep in mind the riskier punches
deal more damage when they do land.

Get to fighting!
