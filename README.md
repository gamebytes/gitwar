======

A platform for git-based turn-based command-line games.

Gitwar and each of its games are written in BASH. That's right.
Git, shell scripting, and playing games has never been so... weird.

## Games

1. [Gitfight](http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitfight)
2. Gitchess - TBD
3. Gitcastle - TBD

## How to play

1. Fork this repo
2. Add a friend as a collaborator
3. CD into the game you want to play
4. Run the executable: `./gitfight`
5. Submit your first turn, and wait for your friend to submit theirs.

## Note

This is more for fun than for anything else. It's just yet another way
of showing how cool git and Github are.

Have fun!
